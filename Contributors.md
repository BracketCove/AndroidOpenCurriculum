  **Name:** Ryan Michael Kay </br>
  **Contributions:** Administration, Educational Content </br>
  **Bio:** I'm a self-taught (primarily) dropout from Canada. Frustrated with the quality of educational content on Android back in 2016, I decided to produce some introductory tutorials on the fundamentals of Android. Over the years, I developed a keen interest in Software Architecture (particularly as taught and explained by Martin Fowler and Robert Cecil Martin), and began to rigorously such principles to my code bases. I've always tried to excel at both the aspect of building applications, as well as explaining how to do so, and I believe my eductional content speaks for itself in that regard.  

My motivation for spearheading this project is to give back to the community which has provided me with a FREE, BETTER 
QUALITY education, than what I received in my one semester of post-secondary eduction in Canada.
