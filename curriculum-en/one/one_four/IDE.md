## Android Studio IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

Android Studio (AS) is widely considered to be the industry standard tool for Android. It is based on Intellij IDEA (created by Jetbrains, which is also responsible for the Kotlin language), and developed by the Android Team (created by Google, which is also responsible for the Android OS). 
 
 In simple terms the acronym IDE means that it is a program which is designed specifically for the purpose of creating other programs. 

This curriculum assumes you will be using this particular IDE. If you do not have Android Studio installed, visit [this link](https://developer.android.com/studio) to download it. With that being said, you may use whatever IDE you prefer (Intellij + Android Plugins, Gradle Wrapper + Notepad). AS studio is a very complex and powerful tool that comes with high system requirements.

## What does AS provide?

Android Studio provides an extensive suite of tools for developing Android Applications, on top of the features and design of Intellij IDEA. In combination with the Gradle Build Tool (discussed in the next module), developers can take advantage of (among other things):
* Graphical Editors for designing parts of the User Interface (Layouts and Views)
* Integration with Revision Control Systems such as Git, SVN, Mercurial 
* Multi-module/platform project support
* Testing configuration and support
* Deployment options for physical devices
* Emulators for testing on virtual devices
* Logging and Performance tracking tools
* Multi-stage compilation process to support mixed Kotlin/Java sources
