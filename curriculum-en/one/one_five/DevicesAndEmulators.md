## Devices And Emulators

Before publishing an application to a distribution platform, it is of **mandatory importance** to deploy it to a physical device or an emulator. Whichever option you choose, you will be expected to be capable of deploying your applications frequently in this curriculum (and throughout your career as an Android developer). Please configure at least one option for test deployment before proceeding to the next part of this course.

## Virtual Devices (Emulators)

Android Studio comes with the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager, which allows creation, configuration, and deployment of emulators. Emulators are virtual devices (which run on your local computer) which can be configured for specific device models (such as a Nexus 6) and Android OS versions. 

While Android Studio's emulators have improved greatly over the past few years in terms of performance, they are often subject to instability and high system requirements to run smoothly. For this reason, it is generally advisable to have at least one physical device to test deploy your applications.

Emulators can require a lot of configuration for smooth operation. You will likely need to select "Create Virtual Device" within the AVD window and follow through with its wizard. Consult the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) for more information on configuring such Emulators.


## Physical Device

Many Android mobile devices can be configured for debugging via a USB connection. Please visit [this page](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html) for a detailed explanation of this process.
