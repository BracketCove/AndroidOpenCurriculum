### Prerequisite Knowledge

This curriculum is intended for individuals who possess a basic understanding of the Java and/or Kotlin programming languages. While extensive knowledge is not required, you will be expected to know enough to understand the examples. 

It is not necessary to know both Java and Kotlin, so you may skip whichever language is not to your preference; this curriculum provides code samples (where appropriate) for all lessons in both languages. For information on which language might be a good choice for you, consult the [F.A.Q. section](README.md) in the landing page.

### Java for Android

Java is a high-level, object oriented programming language which has been used and developed extensively since its first stable release in 1996. Modern computers only understand instructions which are in the form of machine language, which is cumbersome and difficult for humans to read and write. Being a "high-level" programming language, Java is further from machine language and closer to human language. 

As for the Object Oriented (hereby OO) distinction, OO refers to the fact that Java is designed to model real world information and processes in the form of objects; assuming the information is complex enough that it cannot be represent with a single primitive type reference such as an "int" or "char." 

Suggested Prerequisites:
- Java Class creation
- Inheritance via "extends" keyword
- Inherited behaviour via "implements" keyword
- Local Reference Variables (in function)
- Member Variables (Fields) 
- Methods (Functions)
- Visibility Modifiers

You will not be expected to possess a deep knowledge of these topics; just be able to recognize them.

### Kotlin for Android

Inspired by Java (among other languages), Kotlin is a high-level multi-paradigm language which aims to provide a more modern solution to building business/enterprise applications. While it is still geared towards object oriented programming, Kotlin also takes advantage of, and inspiration from, the functional programming paradigm. 

Kotlin is fully supported on the Android Platform, and has exploded in popularity amongst Android Developers since full support was announced in 2017. Thanks to a multi-stage compilation process, Android Studio 3.0, and onwards (we will discuss this program in detail in another lesson), supports projects which are written purely or partially in Kotlin. This allows easy transition and integration with existing Java sources.

Suggested Prerequisites:
- Kotlin Class creation
- Inheritance via ":" character
- Local Reference Values (in function)
- Class Properties (in Class/Constructor)
- Functions
- Visibility Modifiers

You will not be expected to possess a deep knowledge of these topics; just be able to recognize them.

### Alternatives

It is also possible to build Android Applications in C, C++, and C# (along with many other options). Google has also released Flutter SDK for creation of Android and iOS mobile applications. 

The options are either not suggested for beginner developers, or not yet used extensively in production applications. This curriculum may eventually cover such alternatives however.
